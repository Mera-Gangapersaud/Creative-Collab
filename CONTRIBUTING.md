## Finding things to contribute to

Please use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Mera-Gangapersaud/Creative-Collab/issues) to discuss
potential improvements you want to make before sending a Pull Request.

The Issue Tracker may contain items labelled [**help wanted**](https://github.com/Mera-Gangapersaud/Creative-Collab/labels/help%20wanted%20%F0%9F%99%8F%F0%9F%8F%BC) or [**good first bug**](https://github.com/Mera-Gangapersaud/Creative-Collab/labels/good%20first%20bug%20%F0%9F%90%9B)
from time to time.

## Pull Requests

[Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) are used for contributions. Code must be well-tested and not decrease the test coverage significantly.

#### Use a separate branch (not `master`)

Please commit changes to a separate branch in your fork
so that we can work together making changes to it before it
is ready to be merged. Branch names should be named
**issue-X**, where X is the issue number that you are working on.

Once you are ready, you can create a Pull Request for it to be
merged into the `master` branch in this repo.
