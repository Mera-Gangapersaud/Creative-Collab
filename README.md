# Creative-Collab
A creative collaborative writing app


The goal is a real time creative writing collaboration 'game'. 

Each participant takes a turn to add a limited amount of text (ie: 100 words max) to write a short story. Each story will have a maximum of 10 writers and a minimum of 2 who can be anonymous or invited friends. Once each story is finished, it can be exported as a pdf or doc.

This will build the back end of the app which can then be used to further develop front ends on different platforms.

### Running the app
You must have these or a later version installed:

Node version 10.10 | npm version 6.4.1

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
